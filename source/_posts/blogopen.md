# The beginning
After the cinematic, you will begin your journey with two brave warriors, Dismas and Reynauld. Both are predetermined, so they always begin with the same skills, name and perks. This is important because reynauld will always have kleptomaniac, which he will sometimes take treasures for himself, which can be bad for the early game since you need the resources, and dismas will have known cheat, making him unable to gamble to stress heal.

After you finish the tutorial level you will arrive to the hamlet, which is the estate you will have to help grow in order to help you through all your journey. At first you will only have access to certain buildings of your new home, but they will be unlock in time, giving you chances to interact with them and enabling new possibilities to your party members.
